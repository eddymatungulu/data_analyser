Implementation Document for Signal Analyser
1. Introduction
The Signal Analyser is a Python script designed to interact with a web API that provides information about signals collected from various sensors. The script includes functionalities to fetch signal details, retrieve signal values iteratively, calculate statistics (mean, standard deviation), and obtain raw signal data.

2. Purpose
The purpose of this script is to provide a flexible and modular tool for analyzing sensor data from the API. Users can easily obtain information about individual signals, calculate statistics for signal values, and retrieve raw data based on specified parameters.

3. Dependencies
Python 3.x
requests library (for making HTTP requests)
statistics module (for calculating mean and standard deviation)
4. Usage
4.1 Instantiating the Analyser

api_base_url = "https://example.com/api"
analyser = Analyser(api_base_url)

4.2 Fetching Signal Details

signal_id = 123
signal_details = analyser.get_signal_by_id(signal_id)
print("Signal Details:", signal_details)

4.3 Calculating Mean for Signals

start_date = "2024-01-01"
end_date = "2024-02-01"
page_size = 10
offset = 0
signal_id = 123
group = ("laboratory1","machineA")

mean_values = analyser.mean(start_date, end_date, page_size, offset, signal_id, group)
print("Mean Values:", mean_values)

4.4 Calculating Standard Deviation for Signals

std_values = analyser.std(start_date, end_date, page_size, offset, signal_id, group)
print("Standard Deviation Values:", std_values)

4.5 Calculating Both Mean and Standard Deviation for Signals

stats_values = analyser.stats(start_date, end_date, page_size, offset, signal_id, group)
print("Statistics Values:", stats_values)

4.6 Fetching Raw Signal Data

batch_size = 20
raw_data = analyser.raw(start_date, end_date, batch_size, offset, signal_id)
print("Raw Signal Data:", raw_data)

5. Design
The script is designed with modularity in mind, with separate methods for fetching signals, fetching signal details, calculating statistics, and fetching raw data. The use of classes allows for easy instantiation and reuse of the Analyser object.

6. Future Improvements
Potential areas for future improvements include:

Error handling and logging enhancements
Support for additional statistical measures
Improved pagination handling for large datasets

7. Conclusion
The Signal Analyser script provides a convenient and extensible solution for interacting with sensor data from a web API. Users can tailor the script to their specific needs, making it a versatile tool for data analysis.
